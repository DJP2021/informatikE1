Task
Add images to the website of the last course

Use the <img> tag in your code to include images to your website. It does not require a closing tag to work, however it uses the attribute "src" to get an image. Try to download an image you want to include in your website and put it inside the directory of your index.html file. Name it "img1.png" and use your image tag as the following: <img src="img1.png">. Now save the html file and open it to see your result.
